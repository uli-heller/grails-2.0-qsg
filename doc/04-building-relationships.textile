h1. Building Relationships

{toc}

h2. Introduction

This document referres to chapter 4 of the "Grails Quick Start Guide". Yiu have to initialize the project with these commands:

bc. 
uli@uli-desktop:~/git/grails-qsg/chapter-04/TekDays$ echo "y"|../../bin/grails.sh upgrade
| Environment set to development..... 
        WARNING: This target will upgrade an older Grails application to 2.0.3.
        Are you sure you want to continue?
                   [y,n] y
| Plugin 'hibernate' with version '2.0.3' is already installed
| Plugin 'tomcat' with version '2.0.3' is already installed
| Project upgraded

h2. The TekUser Domain Class

bc. 
uli@uli-desktop:~/git/grails-qsg/chapter-04/TekDays$ ../../bin/grails.sh create-domain-class TekUser
| Compiling 38 source files
| Created file grails-app/domain/tekdays/TekUser.groovy
| Created file test/unit/tekdays/TekUserTests.groovy

The domain class gets this filename: grails-app/domain/tekdays/TekUser.groovy.

bc. 
uli@uli-desktop:~/git/grails-qsg/chapter-04/TekDays$ ../../bin/grails.sh create-controller TekUser
| Created file grails-app/controllers/tekdays/TekUserController.groovy
| Created file grails-app/views/tekUser
| Created file test/unit/tekdays/TekUserControllerTests.groovy

The controller gets this filename: grails-app/controllers/tekdays/TekUserController.groovy.

Within "BootStrap.groovy", you have to

* replace @new TekUser(...)@
* by @new tekdays.TekUser(...)@

The view looks like this:

!images/04-41-tekuser-list-view.png!

h2. One-to-One Relationships

Please remember the name of the domain class. It is "TekDays/grails-app/domain/tekdays/TekEvent.groovy".

For "TekUser/grails-app/config/BootStrap.groovy", we have to remember to add the package name "tekdays" to all classnames.

The TekEvent show view looks like this:

!images/04-42-tekevent-with-link.png!

h3. Keeping Our Tests Updated

The name of the test class is "TekDays/test/unit/tekdays/TekEventTests.groovy".

The line to change has to be modified to:

bc. 
  organizer: [fullName: 'John Doe'] as tekdays.TekUser,

Afterwards, the tests don't pass:

bc. 
uli@uli-desktop:~/git/grails-qsg/chapter-04/TekDays$ ../../bin/grails.sh test-app
| Running 4 unit tests... 1 of 4
| Failure:  testSomething(tekdays.TekUserTests)
|  java.lang.AssertionError: Implement me
	at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:93)
	at tekdays.TekUserTests.testSomething(TekUserTests.groovy:15)
...
| Completed 4 unit tests, 3 failed in 2628ms
| Packaging Grails application.....
| Tests FAILED  - view reports in target/test-reports

The tests fail because we use the generated unit test classes for

* tekdays.TekEventControllerTests.groovy
* tekdays.TekUserTests.groovy
* tekdays.TekUserControllerTests.groovy

and they have a call to @fail()@ included. This is an easy fix.

bc. 
uli@uli-desktop:~/git/grails-qsg/chapter-04/TekDays$ ../../bin/grails.sh test-app
| Completed 4 unit tests, 0 failed in 2591ms
| Tests PASSED - view reports in target/test-reports

h2. One-to-Many Relationships

The domain class has this filename: grails-app/domain/tekdays/TekEvent.groovy.

For the BootStrap.groovy class, you have to remember to add "tekdays." to all classnames.

Finally, the TekEvent view looks like this:

!images/04-43-tekevent-with-volunteers.png!

h2. Collections of Simple Data Types

The domain class has this filename: grails-app/domain/tekdays/TekEvent.groovy.

Finally, the TekEvent view looks like this:

!images/04-44-tekevent-with-respondents.png!

h2. Adding a Sponsor Class

Create the domain class:

bc. 
uli@uli-desktop:~/git/grails-qsg/chapter-04/TekDays$ ../../bin/grails.sh create-domain-class Sponsor
| Created file grails-app/domain/tekdays/Sponsor.groovy
| Created file test/unit/tekdays/SponsorTests.groovy

The domain class has this filename: grails-app/domain/tekdays/Sponsor.groovy. Watch out for the line

bc. 
package tekdays

at the top of the class.

Create the controller:

bc. 
uli@uli-desktop:~/git/grails-qsg/chapter-04/TekDays$ ../../bin/grails.sh create-controller Sponsor
| Created file grails-app/controllers/tekdays/SponsorController.groovy
| Created file grails-app/views/sponsor
| Created file test/unit/tekdays/SponsorControllerTests.groovy

The sponsor create view looks like this:

!images/04-46-sponsor-create-view.png!

h2. Many-to-Many Relationships

Create the domain class:

bc. 
uli@uli-desktop:~/git/grails-qsg/chapter-04/TekDays$ ../../bin/grails.sh create-domain-class Sponsorship
| Created file grails-app/domain/tekdays/Sponsorship.groovy
| Created file test/unit/tekdays/SponsorshipTests.groovy

... and the controller:

bc. 
uli@uli-desktop:~/git/grails-qsg/chapter-04/TekDays$ ../../bin/grails.sh create-controller Sponsorship
| Created file grails-app/controllers/tekdays/SponsorshipController.groovy
| Created file grails-app/views/sponsorship
| Created file test/unit/tekdays/SponsorshipControllerTests.groovy

The name of the domain class is: grails-app/domain/tekdays/Sponsorship.groovy.

Now we have to edit these files:

* grails-app/domain/tekdays/Sponsorship.groovy
* grails-app/domain/tekdays/Sponsor.groovy
* grails-app/domain/tekdays/TekEvent.groovy
* grails-app/config/BootStrap.groovy

Finally the event show view with sponsorships looks like this:

!images/04-48-tekevent-with-sponsorships.png!

h2. Finishing Up the Domain Model
