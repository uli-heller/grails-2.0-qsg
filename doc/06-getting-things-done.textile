h1. Getting Things Done

h2. Introduction

This document refers to chapter 6 of the "Grails Quick Start Guide". You have to initialize the project with these commands:

bc. 
uli@uli-desktop:~/git/grails-qsg/chapter-06/TekDays$ echo "y"|../../bin/grails.sh upgrade
| Environment set to development..... 
        WARNING: This target will upgrade an older Grails application to 2.0.3.
        Are you sure you want to continue?
                   [y,n] y
| Plugin 'hibernate' with version '2.0.3' is already installed
| Plugin 'tomcat' with version '2.0.3' is already installed
| Project upgraded

h2. Changing All Our Views At Once

The file "td_logo.png" has to be stored within the folder "web-app/images":

bc. 
uli@uli-desktop:~/git/grails-qsg/chapter-06/TekDays$ cp .../td_logo.png web-app/images/td_logo.png

Within "grails-app/views/layout/main.gsp", this line has to be modified:

bc.
<div id="grailsLogo" role="banner">
  <a href="http://grails.org">
    <img src="${resource(dir: 'images', file: 'td_logo.png')}" alt="Grails"/>
  </a>
</div>

I've splitted the line in parts for better readability. The new homepage looks like this:

!images/06-61-tekdays-new-logo.png!

Using the book's "main.css", the homepage changes to this:

!images/06-61-tekdays-new-css.png!

The message "Skip to content..." can be hidden by modifying "main.css" slightly.
