h2. Introduction

In this chapter, we describe the installation of Grails-2.0.3  on Ubuntu-12.04. This is optional for this project, since we've included the version to the repo.

bc. 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

bc.
sudo apt-get install default-jdk

h3. Grails-Basispaket

bc. 
cd /opt
sudo unzip .../grails-2.0.3.zip

Afterwards, these folders (... and many more) will exist:

* /opt/grails-2.0.3/bin
* ...

h3. Start Script

Filename: $HOME/bin/grails

bc. 
#!/bin/sh
#
GRAILS_HOME=/opt/grails-2.0.3
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
export JAVA_HOME
#
exec ${GRAILS_HOME}/bin/grails "$@"

Permissions: @chmod a+rx $HOME/bin/grails@

h3. PATH

In order to be able to execute Grails by typing @grails@ within the shell, you'll have to extent the environment variable PATH for example by appending these lines to $HOME/.bashrc:

bc. 
PATH="${HOME}/bin:${PATH}"
export PATH

uli@uli-desktop:~$ which grails
/home/uli/bin/grails
uli@uli-desktop:~$ grails --version
.
